# DSAR
Data Subject Access Rights
# DSAR Automation Case Study

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how a company can respond to **Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)** — user requests to access, correct, or delete their personal data.  

Under:
- **PIPEDA**: Individuals have the right to access and correct their personal information.  
- **GDPR**: Articles 12–22 grant access, rectification, deletion, and portability rights.  
- **CPRA (California)**: Expands access and deletion rights for consumers.  

Automation reduces human error, speeds up responses, and ensures compliance with strict deadlines.

---

## Workflow

1. **Intake**: User submits DSAR via web form.  
2. **Verification**: System verifies identity (email token / ID check).  
3. **Triage**: Request type identified (access, correction, deletion, portability).  
4. **Fulfilment**: Data pulled from systems (CRM, HR, databases).  
5. **Response**: Standardized letter sent to user.  
6. **Record-Keeping**: Request logged in DSAR Register (PIPEDA requires accountability).
